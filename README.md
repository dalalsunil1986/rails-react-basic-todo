# ☑️ Basic Full Stack Todo Application
# React Front End & Rails Backend

A debugged Ruby on Rails and React full stack todo application. Styled with Bootswatch's sketch template. This application has simple Post & Delete features. It's a localhost setup, undeployed. This is an educational build and burn, which maybe a useful reference for beginner React or Rails coders.

This app demonstrates knowledge of: 
- Javascript ES6+ Syntax
- React Syntax
- Event Listeners
- Lifecycle Methods
- API Calls 
- Crud actions
- Passing functions as props for prop drilling
- Sending callbacks to other components
- Basic Rails APIs
